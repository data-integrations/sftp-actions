CDAP Action plugin to delete the specified files from the SFTP server.


Use Case
--------
This plugin is generally used along with the SFTP copy plugin. SFTP copy plugin copies the files from SFTP
server to the desired location such as `HDFS`. Once copied to `HDFS`, files can be processed by pipeline.
When the pipeline is successful, the files from SFTP server can be deleted. SFTP delete plugin can be used in
the end of the pipeline to achieve this.
