CDAP Action plugin to delete the specified files from the SFTP server.

Use Case
--------

This plugin is often used with the [SFTP Copy plugin](SFTPCopy-action.md), which copies files from an SFTP server
to a specified location such as `HDFS`. Once copied to `HDFS`, files can then be processed by a pipeline.
When the pipeline is successful, the files from the SFTP server can be deleted. The SFTP Delete plugin can be used at
the end of the pipeline to achieve this.

Plugin Configuration
--------------------

| Configuration | Required | Default | Description |
| :------------ | :------: | :------ | :---------- |
| **Host** | **Y** | N/A | Specifies the host name of the SFTP server. |
| **Port** | **N** | 22 | Specifies the port on which SFTP server is running. |
| **User** | **Y** | N/A | Specifies the name of the user which will be used to connect to the SFTP server. |
| **Password** | **Y** | N/A | Specifies the password of the user. |
| **Files to be deleted** | **Y** | ${sftp.copied.file.names} | Comma-separated list of files on the SFTP server to be deleted. Default value for this field is a Macro which will be substituted by SFTP Copy plugin when this plugin is used with it. |
| **Destination Directory** | **Y** | N/A | Destination directory on the file system, where files need to be copied. If directory does not exist, it will lbe created. |
| **Continue execution on error** | **N** | false | Boolean flag to determine whether to proceed with next files in case there is a failure in deletion of any particular file. |
| **Properties for SSH** | **N** | N/A | Specifies the properties that are used to configure SSH connection to the FTP server. For example, to enable verbose logging, add the property `LogLevel` with the value `VERBOSE`. To enable host key checking, set `StrictHostKeyChecking` to `yes`. SSH can be configured with [these properties](https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config). |
