SFTP Copy copies files from a specified directory on an SFTP server and writes them to a destination in HDFS.
The files that are copied can be optionally uncompressed before storing. The files are copied directly to HDFS without needing any additional staging area.

Usage Notes
-----------
In order to perform an SFTP copy, we require the host and port on which the SFTP server is running. SFTP implements secure file
transfer over SSH. Typically, port number 22 is used for SFTP (which is also the default port for SSH). We also require valid
credentials in the form of a username and password are required. Please make sure that you are able to SSH to the SFTP server using
the specified username and password. The SSH connection to the SFTP server can be customized with options such as host key checking by
setting the configuration property `StrictHostKeyChecking` to `yes`. Additional configurations can be specified in the `Properties for
SSH` section.

The directory to be copied from the SFTP server can be set using the `Source directory` property. The
directory should exist and an absolute path to it must be provided. If directory is empty then execution will
continue without error. `Destination directory` is the absolute path of the directory on HDFS where the files will be copied.
If the destination directory does not exist, it will be created first. If a file with the same name already exists in
the destination directory, it will be overwritten.

Files from the SFTP server can, optionally, be uncompressed while being copied to HDFS. Currently the uncompress option is only supported
for zip files.

Typically, the SFTP server acts as temporary storage for the files and, once processed, the files can be deleted. A
comma-separated list of filenames on the SFTP server which were copied to HDFS during the current run is stored in the
variable `sftp.copied.file.names`. The SFTP Delete action can be configured to run at the end of the pipeline,
which uses this variable to determine the files to be deleted from SFTP server.

Plugin Configuration
--------------------

| Configuration | Required | Default | Description |
| :------------ | :------: | :------ | :---------- |
| **Host** | **Y** | N/A | Specifies the hostname of the SFTP server. |
| **Port** | **N** | 22 | Specifies the port on which SFTP server is running. |
| **User** | **Y** | N/A | Specifies the name of the user which will be used to connect to the SFTP server. |
| **Password** | **Y** | N/A | Specifies the password of the user. |
| **Source Directory** | **Y** | N/A | Absolute path of the directory on the SFTP server which is to be copied. If the directory is empty, the execution of the plugin will be no-op. |
| **Destination Directory** | **Y** | N/A | Destination directory on the file system where files need to be copied. If directory does not exist, it will be created. |
| **Uncompress** | **N** | true | Boolean flag to determine whether to uncompress the `.zip` files while copying. |
| **Variable name to hold list of copied file names** | **N** | sftp.copied.file.names | Name of the variable which holds a comma-separated list of filenames on the SFTP server which were copied during this run of the plugin. Usually this variable is used as a Macro in the SFTP Delete action to delete the files from SFTP server once their processing is successful. |
| **Properties for SSH** | **N** | N/A | Specifies the properties that are used to configure the SSH connection to the SFTP server. For example to enable verbose logging, add property `LogLevel` with value `VERBOSE`. To enable host key checking set `StrictHostKeyChecking` to `yes`. SSH can be configured with the properties described here 'https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config'. |


Build
-----
To build this plugin:

```
   mvn clean package
```

The build will create a .jar and .json file under the ``target`` directory.
These files can be used to deploy your plugins.

Deployment
----------
You can deploy your plugins using the CDAP CLI:

    > load artifact <target/sftp-actions-<version>.jar config-file <target/sftp-actions-<version>.json>

For example, if your artifact is named 'sftp-actions-1.0.0':

    > load artifact target/sftp-actions-1.0.0.jar config-file target/sftp-actions-1.0.0.json
